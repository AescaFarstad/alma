new polygonalization

operates on NavmeshData

it splits triangles into groups:
for each unclassified triangle it starts a flood fill that will join them all into a group:
for each neighbour, if it has an admissible edge with this triangle -> it's added to the group
an admissible edge means that it doesn't create obtuse angle if removed.
specifically for atriangles ABC, BDC:
BC is shared. check AB * AD < AB * AC && AC * AD < AC * AB, where * is a cross product and all edges are of normalizaed length

it passes the edges to the group too.

Next the algorithm runs on each of the groups separately.


for the initial implementation I just want to run some statistics and calculate the size of the largest group and median group.
