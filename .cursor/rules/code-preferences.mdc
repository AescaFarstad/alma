Do not use git unless explisitly requested!
Got forbid you restore or checkout anything from git!
To check for errors run 'npx tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.json'. Do not run it unless the refactor may break things outside of the edited files. For comprehensive refactors, check errors with 'npm run build'
Do not create test files unless explicitly asked. If linting / compiling is unavailable for whatever reason - simply skip it.
Current working directory is '/mnt/WoB/WOB/web%20rep/alma'
Do not run 'npm run dev'. Assume it's already running.
In general do not run scripts unless explicitly requested by the user.
Do not try to run em++ or the map generation node ts scripts unless explicitly requested by user.
Do not assume an issue is fixed until the user says that it is.
Do not remove logs unless the user requested that explicitly.
If you're experiencing problems editing or creating a file, read the file again to check if the edit, which says it's failed, has actually succeeded. It often happens that what was reported as editing failure, was, in fact, a success.
Unless debugging or explicitly asked, do not log successes, only failures and unexpected results.
