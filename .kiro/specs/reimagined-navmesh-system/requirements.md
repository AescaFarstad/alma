# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a reimagined navigation mesh system designed for high-performance pathfinding in a large-scale 2D city map. The system prioritizes a data-oriented approach with offline generation and runtime optimization through worker threads, replacing the current navmesh implementation with a more efficient solution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want an offline navmesh generation pipeline that processes building obstacles into optimized data structures, so that runtime pathfinding performance is maximized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building polygons are processed THEN the system SHALL combine nearby buildings into larger "blobs" when they are too close for agent passage
2. WHEN blobs are created THEN the system SHALL simplify their vertex count using simplification algorithms while preserving original high-detail vertices separately
3. WHEN the walkable area is processed THEN the system SHALL use Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CDT) to generate the mesh with simplified blobs as constraints
4. WHEN impassable blob interiors are processed THEN the system SHALL triangulate them separately for spatial query optimization
5. WHEN triangulation is complete THEN the system SHALL polygonize walkable triangles into larger convex polygons using algorithms like Hertel-Mehlhorn
6. WHEN initial polygonization is complete THEN the system SHALL apply advanced optimization heuristics (k-opt, random restarts) to minimize total polygon count

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a runtime system, I want navmesh data stored in flat, typed arrays using Structure of Arrays format, so that cache-friendly, high-performance access is achieved during gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navmesh data is stored THEN the system SHALL use float32 arrays for vertex coordinates in a unified format
2. WHEN triangle data is stored THEN the system SHALL order triangles as [passable][impassable][fake outer edge] with int32 indices
3. WHEN polygon data is stored THEN the system SHALL use uniform structure for both walkable polygons and impassable blobs
4. WHEN building metadata is stored THEN the system SHALL use binary representation (MessagePack) to avoid JSON.parse() overhead
5. WHEN blob-to-building mapping is needed THEN the system SHALL provide efficient lookup through blob_buildings array
6. WHEN polygon differentiation is required THEN the system SHALL use meta_info bit-flags to distinguish single-building from multi-building blobs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious application, I want auxiliary data structures built in a worker thread at runtime, so that the main UI thread remains responsive during navmesh initialization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navmesh data is loaded THEN the system SHALL construct auxiliary structures in a worker thread
2. WHEN triangle-to-polygon mapping is needed THEN the system SHALL provide O(1) lookup through direct mapping arrays
3. WHEN building-to-blob mapping is required THEN the system SHALL provide O(1) lookup with negligible memory overhead
4. WHEN spatial queries are performed THEN the system SHALL provide separate grid-based indices for triangles, walkable polygons, and impassable blobs
5. WHEN spatial indices are created THEN the system SHALL ensure clean API separation between walkable and impassable areas

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a pathfinding algorithm, I want hierarchical navigation data that supports efficient A* search and path smoothing, so that optimal paths can be computed quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating to a building THEN the system SHALL find the building's parent blob and adjacent walkable polygons for goal selection
2. WHEN performing pathfinding THEN the system SHALL run A* on the high-level polygon graph to find a corridor of polygons
3. WHEN path smoothing is required THEN the system SHALL apply algorithms like Funnel Algorithm using underlying triangle geometry
4. WHEN corridor search is complete THEN the system SHALL provide the straightest possible path through the polygon corridor

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a line-of-sight system, I want efficient raycast functionality that works within the navmesh structure, so that visibility checks can be performed without expensive geometric calculations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN line-of-sight checks are needed THEN the system SHALL provide triangle walk raycast functionality
2. WHEN raycast is performed THEN the system SHALL step through adjacent triangles along the ray's path efficiently
3. WHEN visibility checks are required THEN the system SHALL work within walkable areas of the navmesh
4. WHEN pathing-related visibility is needed THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing Raycasting.ts implementation patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the new navmesh system to replace the existing implementation while maintaining compatibility with current game logic, so that the upgrade is seamless.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new system is implemented THEN it SHALL provide equivalent functionality to the current navmesh system
2. WHEN integration occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing agent navigation logic
3. WHEN data migration happens THEN the system SHALL handle conversion from current data formats
4. WHEN performance testing is conducted THEN the system SHALL demonstrate measurable improvements over the current implementation
